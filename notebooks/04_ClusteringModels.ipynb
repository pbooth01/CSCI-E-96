    "\n",
    "**Clustering models** are core data mining methods. Clustering models are also known as **unsupervised learning** models. The goal of these models is to extract structure and relationships from complex data. Carrying out this type of exploration is difficult since there is no ground truth as a basis of comparison. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment you will work with a complex human resources data set to explore the basic concepts of clustering. Specifically, you will use a [human resources (HR) dataset from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/jacksonchou/hr-analytics). The business goal is to discover common attributes common to employees who leave a large company prematurely in the data. You will use multiple clustering algorithms to build an understanding of the relationships between the variables. Since we do not know in advance which sets of common attributes are important in an employees decision to leave, this is a perfect application for clustering methods.   \n",
    "\n",
    "Evaluation of any unsupervised learning model is a difficult task at the best of times. In this assignment you will use a combination of numeric and graphical evaluation methods. The scope of model evaluation and comparison has deliberately been limited here. Many more methods can and should be applied to complex real-world problems. Regardless of the evaluation methods applied, interpretation of clustering model results remains difficult and requires judgment. \n",
    "\n",
    "As you proceed with the exercises, keep in mind that the relationships in this data set are complex. There are unlikely to be one or just a few simple reasons why a long-term employee chooses to leave their job. Consequently, you should not expect simple well defined results for any analytical model. This type of difficulty and complexity is inherent in many real-world applications of unsupervised learning.    \n",
    "\n",
    "The cluster models you will apply in this assignment have many hyperparameters. To limit the scope of the exercises, values for many hyperparameters are specified in many cases. These values were found by limited exploration of the hyperparameter space. For a real-world project a great deal more time-consuming exploration would be required. \n",

This metric is also know as the **within cluster sum of squares** (see further discussion in the section on evaluating clusters). This step partitions the data into clusters with minimum squared distance to the centroid of the cluster. \n",
    "3. The centroids are moved to mean of each cluster. The means of each cluster is computed and the centroid is moved to the mean. \n",
    "4. Steps 2 and 3 are repeated until a stopping criteria is met. Typically, the algorithm terminates when the within cluster variance decreases only minimally. \n",
    "5. The above steps are repeated starting with a random start of step 1. The best set of clusters by within cluster variance and between cluster separation are retained.  \n",

    "\n",
    "Heirachical clustering models generally use one of two approaches. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Agglomerative clustering** works from the leaves of the tree toward the root in the following way.\n",
    "  - All data cases start in their own cluster. \n",
    "  - Pairs of clusters are merged to their nearest neighbors over several interations. \n",
    "  - The second step is repeated until there is one cluster at the root of the tree. \n",
    "2. **Divisive clustering** works from the root of the tree toward the leaves in the following way.\n",
    "  - All data cases start in a single large cluster. \n",
    "  - Clusters are split into two parts in a way that maximizes the distance (or disimilarity) between the clusters. \n",

    "  \n",

    "\n",
    "Since clusters are typically made up of multiple points we need a way to combine the distances between the points in clusters. We do this through **linkage functions**. There are several commonly used linkage functions. For a distance metric value between two points, $a$ in the one cluster, and $b$ in the other cluster, $D(a,b)$, we can define some common linkage functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Ward's method** is a linkage method that uses a minimum variance criteria to select the pairs of smaller clusters to link.  \n",
    "2. **Maximum or complete-linkage** is the largest value of the distance metric between any pairs of points in the two clusters. \n",
    "$$= Max \\big( D(a,b) \\big)$$\n",
    "3. **Minimum or single-linkage** is the smallest value of the distance metric between any pairs of points in the two clusters. \n",
    "$$= Min \\big( D(a,b) \\big)$$\n",
    "4. **Mean or average linkage** is the average of the distance metrics between all pairs of points in the two clusters.\n",
    "$$= \\frac{1}{N_{ab}} \\sum D(a,b)\\\\ \n",
    "where\\\\\n",
    "N_{ab}\\ is\\ the\\ count\\ of\\ pair-wise\\ distances$$\n",
